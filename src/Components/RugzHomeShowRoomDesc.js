                  <p> The art and story is inspired by infamous rugs, learning experiences,
                   "influencer", and memes who left their mark in the NFT space. The space
                    has been filled with more drama than highschool and we thought it needed a
                    proper narrative. Minimal regulations, large sums of money, greed, and egos have
                     curated a story to be told by no other than the notorious RUGS.
