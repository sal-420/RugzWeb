goToDapp
/* To open a modal before going directly to the DAPP which will show the sample text provided below. 
The text 'goToDapp' will go to the DAPP without showing the modal.  
The text can be anything though it should be intuitive. 
The idea was to control the modal by only changing the text without a re-build and re-publish. 
This did not work because of the way the data is ‘chunked’ at build time
